# Java-Loops
In this problem you will test your knowledge of Java loops. Given three integers a, b, and n, output the following series:

a+20b,a+20b+21b,......,a+20b+21b+...+2n−1b
Input Format

The first line will contain the number of testcases t. Each of the next t lines will have three integers, a, b, and n.

Constraints:

0≤a,b≤50
1≤n≤15
Output Format

Print the answer to each test case in seperate lines.

Sample Input

2
0 2 10
5 3 5
Sample Output

2 6 14 30 62 126 254 510 1022 2046
8 14 26 50 98
Explanation

In the first case:

1st term=0+1*2=2
2nd term=0+1*2+2*2=6
3rd term=0+1*2+2*2+4*2=14
and so on.
